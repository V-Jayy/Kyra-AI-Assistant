Kyra AI Assistant Setup Guide
=============================

1. Run `install_requirements.bat` to install Python dependencies.
2. Use `start_kyra_voice.bat` or `start_kyra_text.bat` to launch Kyra in voice or text mode.
3. Optional: `install_to_cmd.bat` copies Kyra.cmd into your WindowsApps folder so you can run `Kyra` from any terminal. `uninstall_from_cmd.bat` removes it.
4. The assistant supports killing processes via `kill_process`, e.g. "Close Discord" will terminate discord.exe. On Windows the `.exe` extension is added automatically.
